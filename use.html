          You shall not use the Information for any unlawful or unauthorized purpose
        </p>
        <p class="each_p char">The use and interpretation of the Services requires skill and judgment, and you shall at all
          time exercise your own judgement in the use of the Services.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p char">You are responsible for all statements made and acts or omissions that occur while your user
          identification name (or "User Name") and passwords are being used. You are responsible for
          protecting and securing your User Name and password from unauthorized use and
          disclosure. If you become aware of, or believe there has been any breach of security for any
          of your information stored on the PI Digital website, such as the theft or unauthorized use of
          your User Name, password, or any other information, you will notify PI Digital immediately.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p char">The Services have been prepared for informational purposes only without regard to any
          particular user's investment objectives, financial situation, or means, and PI Digital is not
          soliciting any action based upon it. This material is not to be construed as a recommendation;
          or an offer to buy or sell; or the solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any security, financial
          product, or instrument; or to participate in any particular trading strategy in any jurisdiction in
          which such an offer or solicitation, or trading strategy would be illegal. Certain transactions,
          including those involving complex financial instruments, give rise to substantial risk and are
          not suitable for all investors. All of the investment decisions you take shall be based
          exclusively on your own assessment of your financial situation and your investment goals, as
          well as on your own personal interpretation of the information available, in particular the
          opinions, mathematical results and technical analyses published on the website, transmitted
          to you or obtained via the selection and decision-making tools proposed by PI Digital. You are
          solely responsible for such decisions.Investments in financial instruments and/or
          cryptocurrencies featuring on the website are subject to certain risks. The price of financial
          instruments and/or cryptocurrencies may go down as well as up. Fluctuations in foreign
          exchange rates can also alter the value of financial instruments and/or cryptocurrencies. The
          future performance of a financial instrument and/or cryptocurrency cannot be guaranteed by
          past performance. It is therefore possible that you do not get back the amount you invest. It is
          strongly recommended that you seek professional advice before taking investment decisions.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p char">The fact that PI Digital has made the Services available to you constitutes neither a
          recommendation to enter into a particular transaction nor a representation that any product
          described on the website is suitable or appropriate for you. Many of the products described in
          the Services involve significant risks, and you should not enter into any transactions unless
          you have fully understood all such risks and have independently determined that such
          transactions are appropriate for you. Any discussion of the risks contained herein with respect
          to any product should not be considered to be a comprehensive disclosure of all risks or a
          complete discussion of the risks which are mentioned. You should not construe any of the
          material contained herein as business, financial, investment, hedging, trading, legal,
          regulatory, tax, or accounting advice.

        <p class="title_priv">Geographical restrictions – provision of cross-border services</p>
        <p class="each_p">The products and services presented on this website are authorized for sale in Switzerland. They are
          not intended for any person/s who, based on their nationality, place of business, domicile or for any
          other reasons, is/are subject to legal provisions which prohibit foreign financial services providers from
          engaging in business activities in these jurisdictions, or which prohibit or restrict legal entities or
          natural persons from accessing websites of foreign financial services providers.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">Where PI Digital is not authorized by the supervisory authority of a certain country, PI Digital can as a
          general rule not promote financial services in that country.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">In particular, PI Digital is not authorized by the supervisory authorities of the USA, Canada, Great
          Britain, Germany, Italy, and France. This website may however contain information, in particular about
          financial services and products offered by PI Digital, that may be considered by the supervisory
          authorities of the above-mentioned countries as a public offer of financial products or a canvassing
          targeting persons domiciled in the concerned countries. If you are domiciled in one of the
          above-mentioned countries, you confirm that you access this website on your own initiative and
          without any solicitation from PI Digital.

        <p class="title_priv">Website ownership</p>
        <p class="each_p">The website is the exclusive property of PI Digital. PI Digital’s proprietary rights shall not be altered in
          any way by any reproduction or use of the website.
        </p>
        <p class="title_priv">Links</p>
        <p class="each_p">The activation of certain links on the website may cause you to leave the PI Digital website. PI Digital
          does not review any of these linked websites and does not warrant or guarantee, either expressly or
          implicitly, the quality, pertinence, accuracy, completeness, update status, availability or legality of the
          content of these websites, nor shall it be in any way responsible for the products, services, information
          and other content offered via these linked websites. The same applies to websites offering links to PI
          Digital website.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">Furthermore, prior written approval must always be obtained before a link from an external website to
          PI Digital’s website can be created.
        </p>
        <p class="title_priv">Confidentiality and Encryption</p>
        <p class="each_p">Your attention is drawn to the fact that the data exchanged between yourself and PI Digital is
          transmitted via open, public networks (such as the Internet) that are not subject to any controls or
          reviews. The data transferred may travel beyond Switzerland’s borders, even if both yourself and PI
          Digital are located in Switzerland. In addition, even if the data transmitted is encrypted, it may not
          necessarily stay encrypted for the entire duration of the transmission, nor may it necessarily remain
          encrypted at your end: it is possible that data may be intercepted.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">Furthermore, you hereby declare that you have taken note that the legislation applicable in your
          country may prohibit or restrict the importing, exporting or use of encryption logarithms. In no event
          shall PI Digital be responsible for any violations of measures governing the importing, exporting or use
          of encryption logarithms. You alone shall be responsible in the event of any such violation.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">Lastly, your attention is drawn to the fact that information transmitted electronically, e.g. by e-mail or
          SMS, is in principle not encrypted and may be intercepted.
        </p>
        <p class="title_priv">Termination</p>
        <p class="each_p">PI Digital may exercise full discretion in modifying or discontinuing any part or whole of the Services
          specified under points (i) to (v) subject to this Agreement at any time without cause or prior notice.
        </p>
        <p class="title_priv">Disclaimer of Warranties</p>
        <p class="each_p">PI Digital and the Information Provider(s) expressly disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or

        <p class="title_priv">Limited Liability</p>

          any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages arising out of or relating to this
          Agreement or resulting from the use or the inability to use the Services, including but not limited to
          damages for loss of profits, use, data or other intangible damages, even if such party has been
          advised of the possibility of such damages.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">In particular, it is expressly stated that in no event will PI Digital, its directors, officers, employees,
          agents or shareholders be liable for any loss or damages incurred as a result of errors, technical or

          providers.
        </p>
        <p class="title_priv">Indemnification</p>
        <p class="each_p">You agree, at your own expense, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless PI Digital, its suppliers,

          injury or damage to any third party; (iv) any deletions, additions, insertions or alterations to, or any
          unauthorized use of the website by you or someone using your computer; (v) any misrepresentation
          or breach of representation or warranty made by you contained herein; or (vi) any breach of any
          covenant or agreement to be performed by you hereunder. You agree to pay any and all costs,

          event you will fully cooperate with PI Digital in asserting any available defence. You acknowledge and
          agree to pay PI Digital reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with any and all lawsuits
          brought against you by PI Digital under the Agreement and any other terms and conditions applicable

        </p>
        <p class="title_priv">Miscellaneous</p>
