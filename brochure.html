        <p class="each_p">Clients must carefully consider and understand the risk entailed with trading Cryptocurrencies
          (“Digital Assets”) and derivative instruments, including contracts for difference (“CFDs”),
          consider their investment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite before engaging in
          any assets therein.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">PI Digital AG informs clients about the particular risks related to specific types of high risk
          transactions as such, but not about the specific risks relating to each individual transaction. In
          this respect, PI Digital AG has no obligation to inform clients about possible tax and legal
          aspects.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">IMPORTANT NOTICE</p>
        <p class="each_p">Trading activity in Digital Assets and/or derivative instruments, including CFDs, carries
          substantial risks and suits only persons who can assume the risk of a total loss of funds.
          Therefore, clients shall only trade with funds they can afford to lose. Money required securing
          living expenses, educating children, and/or assuring retirement should never be traded.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">Persons unsure or hesitant about a trade must stay on the side-lines. Speculation should not
          be confused with making a long-term conservative investment.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">Digital Assets and derivative instruments, including CFDs markets are amongst the most
          volatile markets in the world.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">Any activity in Digital Assets and CFDs markets necessitates good market understanding,
          experience and personal commitment. Anyone who has doubts concerning the risks or costs
          associated hereunder must immediately request further information from his/her contact
          persons at PI Digital AG and/or from independent advisors. PI Digital AG does not provide any
          tax or legal advice
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">THIS BROCHURE IS A SUMMARY OF THE RISKS INVOLVED IN DIGITAL ASSETS AND
          DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TRADING. IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE EXHAUSTIVE. CLIENTS
          SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THEIR ABILITY AND EXPERIENCE BEFORE
          COMMITTING ANY FUND IN THIS TRADING.
        </p>
        <p class="title_priv">General risks in Digital Assets and/or CFD trading on spot and/or margin:</p>
        <p class="each_p">Trading Digital Assets is not suitable for everyone. Investing in such instruments involves a
          high degree of risk of loss. Before trading you should be aware of the risks involved due to the
          fluctuation in the value of such instruments' prices. Any type of market or trade speculation that
          can yield an unusually high return on investment is subject to unusually high risks. Large
          losses may be suffered within a relatively short period of time due to adverse market
          movements or to position build-up. Before deciding to enter into Digital Assets trading, you
          should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite.
          You should only trade the portion of your own assets you are disposed and cannot afford to
          lose entirely: only your surplus funds should be placed at risk and if you do not have such
          surplus funds you should imperatively avoid engaging in trading. In case of doubts on the risks
          related to Digital Assets trading you should consult any independent financial advisor and
          request any necessary information.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">DIGITAL ASSET VALUES CAN FLUCTUATE SUBSTANTIALLY WHICH MAY RESULT IN A
          TOTAL LOSS OF THE VALUE OF DIGITAL ASSETS HELD BY CRYPTOCURRENCY
          EXCHANGE ON YOUR BEHALF. THE SUPPLY OF DIGITAL ASSETS AVAILABLE TO US OR
          CRYPTOCURRENCY EXCHANGE TO PROVIDE TO YOU AS A RESULT OF A FORKED
          NETWORK AND OUR OR CRYPTOCURRENCY EXCHANGE ABILITY TO DELIVER
          DIGITAL ASSETS RESULTING FROM A FORKED NETWORK MAY DEPEND ON THIRD
          PARTY PROVIDERS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL. WE DO NOT OWN OR CONTROL ANY OF THE PROTOCOLS THAT ARE USED IN CONNECTION WITH DIGITAL
          ASSETS AND THEIR RELATED DIGITAL ASSET NETWORKS, INCLUDING THOSE
          RESULTING FROM A FORKED NETWORK. ACCORDINGLY, WE DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY
          RELATING TO SUCH PROTOCOLS AND ANY CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF ANY DIGITAL
          ASSETS (WHETHER OF A FORKED NETWORK OR OTHERWISE), AND WE MAKE NO
          GUARANTEES REGARDING THE SECURITY, FUNCTIONALITY, OR AVAILABILITY OF
          SUCH PROTOCOLS OR DIGITAL ASSET NETWORKS. YOU ACCEPT ALL RISKS
          ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF CRYPTOCURRENCY EXCHANGE TO CONDUCT
          TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IN CONNECTION WITH THE
          FAILURE OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND INTERNET CONNECTIONS.
        </p>
        <p class="title_priv">Additional Risks:</p>
        <p class="each_p">Please note the following risks in accessing or using Cryptocurrency Exchange and PI Digital
          AG services:
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">The risk of loss in trading Digital Assets may be substantial and losses may occur over a short
          period of time;
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">The price and liquidity of Digital Assets has been subject to large fluctuations in the past and
          may be subject to large fluctuations in the future;
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the separate jurisdiction or international level
          may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Digital Assets;
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">In your jurisdiction, PI Digital AG or Cryptocurrency Exchange may not be regulated as a
          financial institution;
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">Deposits into your Digital Asset Account (i.e., wallet) and your Fiat Account may not be
          considered deposits under the applicable laws, rules, or regulations in Switzerland, your
          jurisdiction or jurisdiction of Cryptocurrency Exchange;
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">Fiat currency in the Fiat Account of your Cryptocurrency Exchange Account may not be
          subject to applicable deposit insurance protection;
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">Digital Assets in the Digital Asset Account (i.e., wallet) of your Cryptocurrency Exchange
          Account (i.e., wallet) are not subject to deposit insurance protection or securities investor
          protections;
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">Digital Assets are not legal tender and are not backed by the government;</p>
        <p class="each_p">Transactions in Digital Assets may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or
          accidental transactions may not be recoverable;
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">Some Digital Asset transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public
          ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that you initiated the transaction;
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">The value of Digital Assets may be derived from the continued willingness of market
          participants to exchange fiat currency or Digital Assets for Digital Assets, which may result in
          the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular Digital Asset should the
          market for that Digital Asset disappear;
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">The nature of Digital Assets may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber attack, and may
          mean that technological difficulties experienced by Cryptocurrency Exchange may prevent the
          access to or use of your Digital Assets; and
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">Any bond or trust account maintained by Cryptocurrency Exchange for the benefit of Its Users
          may not be sufficient to cover all losses due to theft or fraud incurred by Users
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">You agree and understand that you are solely responsible for determining the nature, potential
          value, suitability, and appropriateness of these risks for yourself, including the suitability and
          appropriateness of, and investment strategies for, Digital Assets. You agree and understand
          that you access and use Cryptocurrency Exchange at your own risk; however, this brief
          statement does not disclose all of the risks associated with Digital Assets and using
          Cryptocurrency Exchange, and PI Digital AG services. You should, therefore, carefully
          consider whether such use is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial
          resources. You should be aware that you may sustain a total loss of the funds in your
          Cryptocurrency Exchange Account (i.e., wallet), and that under certain market conditions, you
          may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position.
        </p>
        <p class="title_priv">Past and Hypothetical Performance; Market Opinions</p>
        <p class="each_p">Past performances realised in Digital Assets markets are not indicative of any future
          performance. Hypothetical performance results may be posted on websites for information
          purposes only.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">Such hypothetical performance results are generally based on past performances that are not
          a guarantee of future results. Performance can and does vary between each trader, trading
          strategy and current market situation.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">Anyone who says you can consistently make money in Digital Assets markets is being
          untruthful.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">Any opinions, news, research, analyses, prices, or other information contained on PI Digital
          AG website (www.pidigital.swiss) is provided as general market information, and does not
          constitute any trading advice or recommendation. PI Digital AG will not accept liability for any
          loss or damage, including without limitation to, any loss of profit, which may arise directly or
          indirectly from the use of or reliance on such information.
        </p>
        <p class="title_priv">Brokerage Service</p>
        <p class="each_p">PI Digital AG makes no representation or warranty as to the actual performance of the trades
          executed on behalf of the investor through PI Digital AG brokerage service. PI Digital AG
          executes trades on behalf of the client which corresponds to the trades carried out in respect
          of a client order. Some trades operate with leverage due to the use of margin products and a
          high degree of discretion and exposures towards single financial instruments and asset
          classes, and PI Digital AG brokerage service may therefore entail significant risks.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">All investments entail risks and may result in both profits and losses. In particular, investments
          in leveraged products, such as, but not limited to cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange,
          derivatives and commodities can be very speculative and profits and losses may fluctuate both
          violently and rapidly. Speculative trading is not suitable for all investors and all recipients
          should carefully consider their financial situation and consult financial advisor(s) in order to
          understand the risks involved and ensure the suitability of their situation prior to making any
          investment, divestment or entering into any transaction.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">Past performance is not a guide to future performance and should not be the sole factor of
          consideration when selecting an investment portfolio or an asset, or a financial instrument. The
          price of the investments may go up or down and the investor may not get back the amount
          invested. Your income is not fixed and may fluctuate. The value of investments involving
          exposure to cryptocurrencies and/or foreign currencies can be affected by exchange rate
          movements. You are reminded that the levels and bases of, and reliefs from, taxation can
          change.
        </p>
        <p class="each_p">PI Digital AG shall not be liable for (i) any loss which the investor may suffer as a consequence
          of the trading and transactions executed by PI Digital AG; (ii) any loss suffered or incurred by
          the investor as a result of or in connection with PI Digital’s AG provision of brokerage service;
          (iii) any loss due to actions taken by PI Digital AG according to its rights; (iv) any consequential
          or other indirect loss (including loss of profit and loss of goodwill) suffered or incurred by the
          investor whether arising from PI Digital’s AG negligence or otherwise; or (v) any loss
          exceeding PI Digital’s AG revenue on the account(s) or cryptocurrency wallet(s) of the client
          for any 12 month period prior to the client's raising of a claim against PI Digital AG.

        <p class="each_p">You agree and understand that by using Cryptocurrency Exchange and/or PI Digital AG and
          placing Orders, you have sufficient knowledge to place such Orders. You are responsible for
          making sure that any Orders placed by you are accurate and intentional. We may, in some
